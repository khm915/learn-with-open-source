## several methods to learn software development

### a fairy tale of ten thousand hours

I talked about a topic about the fairy tale of ten thousand hours. There is an opinion in a book named the wrong type that there is no such thing as absolute genius. Genius also requires more than 10,000 hours of training. Everyone has the chance to become a top master.You can refer to a well-known passage¡¶[How to practice for 10,000 hours](http://www.geekonomics10000.com/519)¡·.

Based on this theory, there is a concept of "10,000 hours of taining". It's seemed that everyone can become a master in software development after the training.However,this theory is only a fake one based on statistics.

First of all, how to determine the boundary of the domain? what is the scope of a domain? The scope of programming is so big that complier and database programming are two defferent domains in it. If someone spends 10,000 hours concentrating on complier development, he may be unfamiliar with database. At that time, whether that person is a master in software development or not? Furthermore, if someone concentrates on assembly language programming,will he do well in the new scripting languages that face objects.

Then,how to think about the exercises? In the 10,000-hour statistics, there are many areas that need to be practiced repeatedly, such as dance, music and so on. Is this kind of training for proficiency really needed in the field of programming? Of course, I believe that improving typing speed does help improve the speed of writing code, but does it really help to improve the ability of programming? In the field of software development, it will be very difficult to discuss how to program after 10,000 hours of training. 

Finally, it is about knowledge renewal. In a field where new terms, new technologies and new ideas are born every day, a master who has worked hard for 10,000 hours can still be called a master after not touching the latest knowledge for three years.

In short, the hasty acceptance of the concept of 10,000 hours, inspired by the enthusiasm for the determination to study 10,000 hours of programming, is usually just a symptom of "inspirational book poisoning."
